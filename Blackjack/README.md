# Blackjack ðŸŽ´

A minimalist, responsive Blackjack game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** â€” no dependencies, no frameworks, just pure browser fun.

## How It Works
The game simulates a single-deck Blackjack table:
1. **New Round** deals two cards to the player and two to the dealer (one face-down).
2. **Hit** gives the player an extra card. If the total exceeds 21, you bust.
3. **Stand** ends your turn, revealing the dealerâ€™s hidden card. The dealer draws until reaching at least 17.
4. Results are displayed immediately: win, lose, or push.
5. **Restart** clears the board and resets the game state.

Ace values are automatically adjusted from 11 to 1 if needed to avoid busting.
